    <title>Migrate volumes</title>
    <para>The Havana release of OpenStack introduces the ability to
        migrate volumes between back-ends. Migrating a volume
        transparently moves its data from the current back-end for the
        volume to a new one. This is an administrator function, and
        can be used for functions including storage evacuation (for
        maintenance or decommissioning), or manual optimizations (for
        example, performance, reliability, or cost).</para>
    <para>These workflows are possible for a migration:</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>If the storage can migrate the volume on its own, it
                is given the opportunity to do so. This allows the
                Block Storage driver to enable optimizations that the
                storage might be able to perform. If the back-end is
                not able to perform the migration, the Block Storage
                Service uses one of two generic flows, as
                follows.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>If the volume is not attached, the Block Storage
                Service creates a volume and copies the data from the
                original to the new volume. Note: While most
                back-ends support this function, not all do. See
                driver documentation in the <link
                    xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/havana/config-reference/content/"

                        Reference</citetitle></link> for more
                details.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>If the volume is attached to a VM instance, the
                Block Storage Service creates a volume, and calls
                Compute to copy the data from the original to the new
                volume. Currently, this is supported by the
                Compute libvirt driver.</para>

    <para>As an example, this scenario shows two LVM back-ends and
        migrates an attached volume from one to the other. This
        scenario uses the third migration flow.</para>

    <para>Note these attributes:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><literal>os-vol-host-attr:host</literal> - the
                volume's current back-end.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><literal>os-vol-mig-status-attr:migstat</literal> -
                the status of this volume's migration ('None' means
                that a migration is not currently in progress).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><literal>os-vol-mig-status-attr:name_id</literal> -
                the volume ID that this volume's name on the back-end
                is based on. Before a volume is ever migrated, its
                name on the back-end storage may be based on the
                volume's ID (see the volume_name_template
                configuration parameter). For example, if
                volume_name_template is kept as the default value
                (volume-%s), your first LVM back-end has a logical
                volume named
                    <literal>volume-6088f80a-f116-4331-ad48-9afb0dfb196c</literal>.
                During the course of a migration, if you create a
                volume and copy over the data, the volume gets the new name but keeps its
                original ID. This is
                exposed by the <literal>name_id</literal>
                attribute.</para>

    <para>You can use the <command>cinder show</command> command to
        see the status of the migration. While migrating, the
            <literal>migstat</literal> attribute shows states such as
            <literal>migrating</literal> or
            <literal>completing</literal>. On error,
            <literal>migstat</literal> is set to
            <literal>None</literal> and the <literal>host</literal>
        attribute shows the original host. On success, in this
        example, the output looks like:</para>

            However, some operations are not be allowed while a
            migration is taking place, such as attaching/detaching a
            volume and deleting a volume. If a user performs such an
            action during a migration, an error is returned.</para>
